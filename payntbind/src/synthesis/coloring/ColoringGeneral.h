/**
 * A general coloring: each choice of the quotient MDP is colored by a quantifier-free formula over the parameters,
 * and an assignment to parameters enables a choice iff it satisfies the formula.
 *
 * Representation. The colors are a node table built in Python by paynt/utils/coloring_builder.py; the constructor lists
 * the operands of each NodeOp. Colors are written in z3py, which links a potentially different Z3 than this library, 
 * so they arrive as plain data. Data columns (a row per state and per choice) let one formula color many choices. 
 * Invariants: children have smaller ids than their parents; parameter values are option indices; 
 * choice_root[c] == -1 means that c is uncolored, i.e. always enabled.
 *
 * Three readers implement the meaning of the table and must agree with the z3py formula: the Kleene evaluation
 * (selectCompatibleChoices, relevantParameters), the Z3 translation (areChoicesConsistent, exact mode) and
 * paynt.utils.coloring.choice_formula. A new NodeOp needs a case in the constructor's scope/support pass,
 * computeFormula or computeTerm, buildFormula or buildTerm, unionReasonTrue/False, the builder and choice_formula.
 *
 * Kleene evaluation. Under a given assignment to the parameters, a formula evaluates to T (every member satisfies it), 
 * F (no member does) or U (unknown), and a term to an interval that contains its value in every member. 
 * A choice is selected unless its formula is evaluated to F.
 * Every step over-approximates, so a choice that some member enables is never dropped, and on a full assignment the
 * result is exact. On a partial assignment it is exact if every comparison is between a bare parameter and data or constants
 * (InSetF and InBitsF are of this kind) and, in addition, every parameter occurs at most once in the color, or the color
 * has no negation and every And joins parts over different parameters (decision trees, lifted standard colorings).
 * Otherwise it may keep a choice that no member enables, e.g. `And(p >= 1, p <= 2)` or `p + 1 == 3 for p in {0, 3};` that
 * only enlarges the sub-MDP, meaning it is still a safe abstraction. 
 * Deciding this exactly is NP-complete in general! Exact mode does it with Z3, much more slowly.
 *
 * A node is evaluated once per query, per state or per choice, depending on whether it reads no data, state data or
 * choice data; epoch counters invalidate these caches. The caches and the query context are members: one query at a
 * time, not thread-safe.
