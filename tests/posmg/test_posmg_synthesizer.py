        Regression test for the re-unfolding path specifically: test-game's optimum improves from ~0.375
        at memory size 1 to ~0.439453 once the optimizing player gets a second memory state, and the
        specification's tracked optimum reflects it. mec-test wouldn't catch a broken re-unfold here since
        its observations are all single-state and memory size never changes anything for it.

        Synthesis is deterministic, so the synthesized assignment at each memory size is checked too, not
        just the value it achieves.
