        Regression test for the full AR + POMDP-specialized scoring path: this sketch's parameter space (1e10) is
        small enough that AR fully converges within the test, so the reported optimum is the true value
        for a 1-node FSC (the fixture's default memory size), not just a snapshot -- and AR's correctness
        doesn't depend on the splitting heuristic (utils.scoring.estimate_scheduler_difference_pomdp) being
        right, only on it terminating, so this also catches that free function crashing or looping.

        Since synthesis is deterministic, the actions the assignment picks are checked too (not just the
        reward value) -- the observation labels embedded in str(assignment) contain incidental tab
        formatting from stormpy's own label rendering, so only the "=action" side is extracted, avoiding a
        brittle whitespace-sensitive comparison while still checking the synthesized decision itself.
